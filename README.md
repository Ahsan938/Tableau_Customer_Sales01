The examination of the customer analysis in Tableau has yielded insightful findings across various dimensions. In terms of age groups, sales data indicates that individuals below the age of 20 contribute the least to revenue, amounting to $7 million. Interestingly, the sales distribution for those between 20 and 60 years old appears relatively uniform in a histogram, with a noticeable dip in revenue for those above 70 years old.

Geographically, the revenue analysis by state in the United States shows that California (CA) and Texas (TX) lead in terms of sales, underscoring the significance of these regions in your customer base. A correlation between quantity and discount reveals that as discounts increase, the quantity ordered also tends to increase, suggesting a potential strategy for driving higher sales through targeted discount offerings.

Examining revenue across regions, the South and Midwest emerge as the leaders, indicating potential areas for increased focus or expansion. Analyzing revenue per category per gender highlights tablets and mobiles as the highest revenue generators, followed by appliances, while the Kids & Baby category contributes the least to overall revenue.

Finally, the temporal aspect of sales reveals dynamic patterns from October 2020 to August 2021. Sales peak from November 2020 to January 2021, reaching $57 million, and a vice versa pattern suggests fluctuating sales performance during the specified period. These insights provide a comprehensive understanding of your customer analysis, offering valuable information for strategic decision-making and targeted improvements in specific areas.
